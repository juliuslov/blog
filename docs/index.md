# Hello! I'm Juliette (you can call me Julius)
This is my blog site built with Mkdocs with Obsidian makes for a pretty slick setup. If youâ€™re ever looking for blog ideas, ways to organize my blog so my blog use *GitHub Pages* (yeah it was a part of GitHub)
> [!hint]
> `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` (you need enable Pages on **Settings -> Pages**, if you have `gh-pages` branch to deploy? Set it), I think it will helpful for your alternative way of Obsidian Publish, you never know it!
